To use this:- 

Go to ST3 top --> Tools --> Build System --> New Build system
Now a file should open in Sublime Text, delete everything in this file and paste the contents in it.
save the file as "whatever you want"(just name it run-python-cmdnx). Make sure that it ends with a .sublime-build
After that go to build system again and choose the file you just made.

Whever you want to run your code, just hit Ctrl+b or go to the top in Tools --> and click build

**I found this helpful as I had problems run my code in Sublime Text 3. I hope you find this helpful.**
